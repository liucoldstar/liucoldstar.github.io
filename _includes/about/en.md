Hi, I am Andy Liu (Liu, Jie), a senior application engineer at [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/). My hobbies are Linux kernel / device driver development, all sorts of real-time operating systems and embedded TCP/IP stacks.

I got my bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University) and master's degree at [Tsinghua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University). My research area is Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in my master period.

Currently, I'm working on a book, which explains in details how to port a lightweight TCP/IP stack [lwIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LwIP) to different real-time operating systems (e.g. [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/), [¬µC/OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-Controller_Operating_Systems) and [eCos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECos)) and microcontroller platformsÔºàe.g. ARM9, ARM11, ARM Cortex-A5 and ARM Cortex-A8Ôºâ.
